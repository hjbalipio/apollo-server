# apollo-server

## Overview
This project showcases the GraphQL, a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for our data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to the traditional REST API.

### What are the benefits of GraphQL

- <b>Efficiency</b>: Fetch only the data you need in a single request.
- <b>Flexibility</b>: Query multiple resources in a single request.
- <b>Strong Typed</b>: A clear contract for what is possible to query and mutate.
- <b>Introspection</b>: Ability to query the schema itself for documentation and tooling.

### Learn GraphQL Terminology
- <b>Schema</b>: Defines types and relationships in the API.
- <b>Resolvers</b>: Functions that handle fetching the data.
- <b>Queries</b>: Read operations to fetch data.
- <b>Mutations</b>: Write operations to modify data.
- <b>Subscriptions</b>: Real-time updates from the server.
- <b>Fragments</b>: Resuable units for query parts.

### Modern Design Principles

Understand modern design principles to create clean, maintainable, and scalable GrapQL APIs. This includes concepts like modularization, separation of concerns, and leveraging GraphQL's type system

### Adding Authentication

Integrate authentication mechanism to secure your GraphQL API, ensuring that users have appropriate permissions to access or modify the data.

### Working with Prisma v3 to Interact with a Postgres DB

Learn how to use Prisma v3, a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, to interact with a PostgresQL database. This will include setting up Prisma, defining data models, and performing CRUD operations.

### Connecting GraphQL to the Client

Discover how to connect your GraphQL server to a client application, using popular libraries like Apollo Client to manage data fetching and state on the client-side.

### Improve Performance by Learning about the N + 1 Problem and Solving it with Data Loaders

The N + 1 problem is a common performance issue in GraphQL. You will learn how to identify this problem and use Data Loaders to batch and cache reuqests, significantly improving your API's performance.

At the end, you will have a solid foundation in GraphQL and be well-equipped to implement it int your projects, ensuring efficient, scalable, and maintainable API solutions.
