Question #2. How would you handle email unique constraint error in signup mutation? 
I know, we could use prisma to find whether the email provided is exist from the user model.
What is the best generic error message we could tell to the user as you mentioned that we wont 
gonna tell to the user whether the email is in the database? What if the user who is trying to singup is legit, 
but somehow this user had forgot that he / she already signup before.?
